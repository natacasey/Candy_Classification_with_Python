# Candy Classification with Python
![candy](https://github.com/natacasey/Candy_Classification_with_Python/blob/master/_assets/candy.jpg)

## Project description
The goal of the project is to predict if candy is chocolate or not based on the features included in the Halloween candy data set downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking). 
The performance of the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models with tuned hyperparanmeters and feature selection was analyzed to select a final model.

## Development

Programming language - Python 3.7. OS - Windows 10 Home.

## Additional questions asked of the data:
Is the candy with nuts more likely to be chocolate candy? Or maybe it is more likely to be chocolate if it has caramel in it, nougat, or wafers?
Does chocolate candy contain more sugar than candy that is not chocolate? Is it more expensive? Finally, is chocolate candy more popular?

## Lmitations of the project
The data set does not have a large number of observations. More accurate results could be achieved with a larger sample.
